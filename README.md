The world has been built by contingent in a big scale. If there is no Steve Job, then today our phone and laptop may look differently. When you look back, you feel there is a necessity the world goes one way than others. That is not true, and never be true. The reality is only individuals own the scope to define the world. 

You will always fail with the time. If you didn’t reach the goal, you basically fail. But luckily you reached the goal, you probably will create a new goal. You will fail with the new goal eventually. Or you decide to quit, the goal you originally achieved will be faded away because someone else did a better job, or opposite nobody cares it anymore. No matter what, with the limit lifetime everyone has, everyone fails in the end. 

So you don’t need feel scared of anything since you know the final result. But you can define the world with your own vision in the given time you have.

I start to track what I read: short articles and books, and what I am thinking. If everyone is a unique Intelligent Model, it will be measured by the input and output. The input will be the information you consume, and the output is the logic you built and reflect on the work you have and the code you built.
