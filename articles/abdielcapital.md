## Abdiel Capital Investment ##

[Abdiel](https://abdielcapital.com/about/) generally invests in public trade company with the goal that gains market share over 3-5 year time frame.

Also they prefer the business with recurring revenue and is managed by people with a large share of their net worth in the stock. They are pretty focus on 20/80 rule with their the top ten largest stock and hold it permanently. They invested the senior leader's responsiblity in the company rather than something else.

I really hope to have some time to investigate their logic to do stock picking in a more detail way.
