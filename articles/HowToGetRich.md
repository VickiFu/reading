Naval had shared his thoughts about various topics. 

- Go to find out the world what people need, and try to provide those with a scale approach. The money is the measurement for the impact or the help you provide to the world.

- How to get luck in the game. I guess there are three rules:
  1) always help other people as much as possible. And makes friends. 
  2) have the independent thinking, be curious, and good judgement for things around you.
  3) work as hard as possible, and try as many things as possible.
