Naval had shared his thoughts about various topics. 

- Go to find out the world what people need, and try to provide those with a scale approach. You should give society what it doesn't know how to get. The money is the measurement for the impact or the help you provide to the world. 

- How to get luck in the game. I guess there are three rules:
  1) always help other people as much as possible. And makes friends. 
  2) have the independent thinking, be curious, and good judgement for things around you.
  3) work as hard as possible, and try as many things as possible.

- You can never be rich by renting out of your time. Because what you earn will always be linear. And what you do will always be replaceable. Only ownership for equity can help you reach the financial freedom. 

- Reading and learning is the most correct way to prepare yourself to be rich. And math and logic thinking are the best tools to help hardworking people from the ordinary family to reach the goal.

Take risks under your own name and society will reward you with leverage. You need accountability to get leveraged. When you have a team, you need make sure everyone has the clear accountability for something. but you want to stay out of labour-based leverage. Capital play well as the leverage in the last century, because it is easy to converted to labour and other things.  **The product and Media are the new leverage in the Internet world**.

The robot world is coming. AI hardly can achieve anything if they are not married with the business idea. But if you are thinking about solving complicated business problem, you have to tune AI solution for every detail scenario for the detail use case. So the sweet spot for Machine Learning and AI is to find some fun and simple enough business scenario and apply intelligence capability in it. 

The most sweet spot will be some product to fit the middle class need and hold the philosophy about equal right for all human beings. Also you want to have the network affect, low marginal cost and scalibity.

Judgement is the top priority to build your vision. Long term, linger one's desires, build to last. Top investors often sound like philosophers. Cost efficient daily decision makes if the value you brought is less few hundred dollars per hours, you should not do those work by yourself. **All your hours you should spend on are building your product, finding product-market fit, exercising and eating healthy. That is all about it**. *The key to find founder-product-market fit for your business*. 

Eventually you will get what you deserved. Avoid all the competition by be authenticity.
