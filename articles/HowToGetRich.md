## [How to Get Rich](https://nav.al/rich) ##

Naval had shared his thoughts about various topics. 

- Go to find out the world what people need, and try to provide those with a scale approach. You should give society what it doesn't know how to get. The money is the measurement for the impact or the help you provide to the world. 

- How to get luck in the game. I guess there are three rules:
  1) always help other people as much as possible. And makes friends. 
  2) have the independent thinking, be curious, and good judgement for things around you.
  3) work as hard as possible, and try as many things as possible.

- You can never be rich by renting out of your time. Because what you earn will always be linear. And what you do will always be replaceable. Only ownership for equity can help you reach the financial freedom. 

- Reading and learning is the most correct way to prepare yourself to be rich. And math and logic thinking are the best tools to help hardworking people from ordinary family to reach the goal.

Take risks under your own name and society will reward you with leverage. You need accountablity to get leverage. When you have a team, you need make sure everyone has the clear accountablity for something. but you want to stay out of labor-based leverage. Capital play well as the leverage in the last century, because it is easy to converted to labor and other things.  **Product and Media are the new leverage in the Internet world**.
