[Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow Concepts  Tools  and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems](https://amzn.to/2Jq6PIo)

If you only want one book for Machine Learning and Deep learning, this will be the one! If you need two, I recommend you read this book twice, seriously. 

[Deep Learning with Python](https://amzn.to/3dJXzgj)

I knew you will ask me to give another recommendation for machine learning and deep learning book. This is the one, which is from Kera creator Fran√ßois Chollet. The only downside for this book is published in 2018, some of syntax for Google TensorFlow and Keras have some update, which is not covered in this book.
