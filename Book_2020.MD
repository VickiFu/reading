#### [Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow Concepts  Tools  and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems](https://amzn.to/2Jq6PIo)

If you only want one book for Machine Learning and Deep learning, this will be the one! If you need two, I recommend you read this book twice, seriously. 

#### [Deep Learning with Python](https://amzn.to/3dJXzgj)

I knew you will ask me to give another recommendation for machine learning and deep learning book. This is from Kera creator Fran√ßois Chollet. The only downside for this book was published in 2018, some of syntax for Google TensorFlow and Keras had been some update, which is not covered in this book.

#### [The Hard Thing About Hard Things: Building a Business When There Are No Easy Answers](https://amzn.to/2wCMxJ2) 

Everytime you read it, you will learn something new from it. This is the manual for every entrepreneur

#### [Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup](https://amzn.to/2ThUkUM)

It is impressive that a liar can lead this unrealistic vision and get supported by venture capitals, various professionals, senior executives and so on. The key question is how she Elizabeth Holmes get it: "**Have almost too much self-belief**." 
Also Walgreen has the anxiety that they don't want to miss out by the big idea, and worry that CVS could get it. 


#### [Option B: Facing Adversity, Building Resilience, and Finding Joy](https://amzn.to/2wOwd7P)

[Lean In](https://amzn.to/3atRkuW) is a better book, which has refreshed for my own mindset in my early career. I feel blessed that this book was available early enough for me. And I had recommended all the female professionals in my team to read this book.
