If you only want one book for Machine Learning and Deep learning, this will be the one! If you need two, I recommend you read this book twice, seriously.

#### [Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup](https://amzn.to/2ThUkUM)

It is impressive that a liar can lead this unrealistic vision and get supported by venture capitals, various professionals, senior executives and so on. The key question is how she Elizabeth Holmes get it: "**Have almost too much self-belief**." 
Also Walgreen has the anxiety that they don't want to miss out by the big idea, and worry that CVS could get it. 


#### [Option B: Facing Adversity, Building Resilience, and Finding Joy](https://amzn.to/2wOwd7P)

[Lean In](https://amzn.to/3atRkuW) is a better book, which has refreshed for my own mindset in my early career. I felt blessed that [Lean In](https://amzn.to/3atRkuW) this book was available early enough. And I had recommended all the female professionals in my team to read [Lean In](https://amzn.to/3atRkuW).

#### [Thinking in Bets: Making Smarter Decisions When You Don't Have All the Facts](https://amzn.to/344g36o)

When the bar for publishing get lower and lower, it is so much easier to writing a book with the single theory and a dozen of stories to support the theory. Stay focused and make a decision when you put all the eggs in the bucket. And get suggestions from professionals around you, and the better network you have the better decision you can make.
