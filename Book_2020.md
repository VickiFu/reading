#### [Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow Concepts  Tools  and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems](https://amzn.to/2Jq6PIo)

If you only want one book for Machine Learning and Deep learning, this will be the one! If you need two, I recommend you read this book twice, seriously. 

#### [Deep Learning with Python](https://amzn.to/3dJXzgj)

I knew you will ask me to give another recommendation for machine learning and deep learning book. This is from Kera creator Fran√ßois Chollet. The only downside for this book was published in 2018, some of syntax for Google TensorFlow and Keras had been some update, which is not covered in this book.

#### [Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup](https://amzn.to/2ThUkUM)

It is impressive that a liar can lead this unrealistic vision and get supported by venture capitals, various professionals, senior executives and so on. The key question is how she Elizabeth Holmes get it: "**Have almost too much self-belief**." 
Also Walgreen has the anxiety that they don't want to miss out by the big idea, and worry that CVS could get it. 


#### [Option B: Facing Adversity, Building Resilience, and Finding Joy](https://amzn.to/2wOwd7P)

[Lean In](https://amzn.to/3atRkuW) is a better book, which has refreshed for my own mindset in my early career. I felt blessed that [Lean In](https://amzn.to/3atRkuW) this book was available early enough. And I had recommended all the female professionals in my team to read [Lean In](https://amzn.to/3atRkuW).

#### [Thinking in Bets: Making Smarter Decisions When You Don't Have All the Facts](https://amzn.to/344g36o)

When the bar for publishing get lower and lower, it is so much easier to writing a book with the single theory and a dozen of stories to support the theory. Stay focused and make a decision when you put all the eggs in the bucket. And get suggestions from professionals around you, and the better network you have the better decision you can make.

#### [The Gentle Art of Swedish Death Cleaning: How to Free Yourself and Your Family from a Lifetime of Clutter](https://www.amazon.com/Gentle-Art-Swedish-Death-Cleaning/dp/1501173243/)
What a long name for a book! The elegant lady has the great thoughts about death cleaning: how to deal with her own collection of things after her life. Rather than bothering family members for this work, she plan to do gradually before she get too old. Recently I had read a section in the New York Times for the memorial weekend. They list the names they collected from news who has passed away from COVID-19. Everyone has one sentence to summary who they are. I had sent a mail and a check to buy this special edition from their achieve store. I hope to keep this and keep redefining who I am.
